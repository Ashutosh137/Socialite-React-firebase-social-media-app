# Running Socialite React App with Docker

This repository contains the Dockerfile and instructions to run a Docker container for the Socialite React App.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have Docker installed on your system. You can download and install Docker from [here](https://www.docker.com/get-started).

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ashutosh137/Socialite-React-firebase-social-media-app
   ```

2. Navigate to the cloned directory:

   ```bash
   cd socialite-react-docker
   ```

3. Build the Docker image:

   ```bash
   docker build -t socialite-react .
   ```

4. Run the Docker container:

   ```bash
   docker run -it -p 3000:5173 socialite-react
   ```

   This command will start the React app and expose it on port 3000. You can access the app by visiting http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.

## Customizations

If you need to customize any environment variables or configurations, you can modify the Dockerfile before building the image.

## Troubleshooting

- **Port Already in Use**: If port 3000 is already in use on your system, you can change the port mapping in the `docker run` command to a different available port, for example:

  ```bash
  docker run -it -p 4000:5173 socialite-react
  ```

or

just write "docker pull ashutosh136/socialite:latest" on cmd
